		<p>You can view what the response contains by adding <mark>console.log(dataIn);</mark> after 
			<mark>var dataIn = JSON.parse(request.responseText);</mark> 
			as provided in the above JavaScript code. Hitting f12 in most browsers will bring up
			the console window. <mark>JSON.parse();</mark> is used to parse the response 
			into a format that allows us to access the properties that we need. If you are not familiar with JSON, 
			you can learn about it <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp">HERE</a>	
		</br></br>
			Keep in mind that dataIn is the variable that we have assigned the response to. 
			By opening the browsers console window after opening the page that implements our 
			APoD code, we can see that the response has the following properties, all containing 
			strings of some sort:	
		</p>
		
		<img class="thumbnail" src="images/GETimage.png">
		<div>Note: The response information shown in the image above will not match yours because it occurred
		on a different day.</div>
		
		<p>These properties are what we will access in order to populate a webpage with the title, 
			image, and, description. The code example shows that this is done using 
			the <mark>document.getElementById()</mark> method and setting the proper HTML property equal to the 
			proper response property. If we get an error and the response we expect is not received, 
			then an error message will show up in place of the title. 
			</br></br>
			Notice that we do not actually send the request until after the event listener is added to the 
			request. The code contained by the function that is an argument of <mark>addEventListener</mark>, 
			does not actually get executed until a response is received. 
			</br></br>
