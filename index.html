		<h1 class="page-header">Introduction</h1>
		<p>This how-to guide will explain what the NASA API is and how
		to make requests to NASA's server in order to retrieve data. This tutorial will also provide examples showing
		what you can do with that data. This guide assumes that
		you have a basic knowledge of HTML and javascript. Throughout this tutorial,
		javascript and HTML code examples will be shown. When I refer to particular bits
		of code within these examples, I will highlight the code, <mark>like this</mark>, to help the 
		reader distinguish between code and regular text. This guide covers topics and includes 
		details that are not a part of NASA's own API documentation. However, if you'd like to 
		refer to NASA's documentation, you can find it <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/index.html">HERE</a>.</p>
		
		<h3 class="page-header">What is an API?</h3>
		<p>API stands for "Application Programming Interface". An API provides a way for a programmer to 
		access the data from a server in order to do something with that data. For instance, 
		many companies track weather data for different purposes. Beyond the companies need for 
		that data, it is obvious that others might have a use for the data as well. The company 
		decides to make this data available to others for their own purposes. 
		A programmer can use their API in order to get the data and then use it for their own applications.</p>
		
		<h3 class="page-header">Why use NASA's API</h3>
		<p>The NASA API provides many interesting options. Several of NASA’s API calls allow one to 
		retrieve and use images that were taken using NASA’s technology. This would allow you to 
		automatically generate a different image each day. 
		Other calls have less asthetic purposes, such as providing 
		info about near-earth asteroids. This could allow one to use the near-earth asteroid 
		data to create a dynamic diagram that displays data for specific dates. 
		This guide will show you how to interact with 
		the NASA API and develop some useful functions that will help in the process.</p>
		
		<h3 class="page-header">Get an API key</h3>
		<p>The first thing you’ll do in order to use the NASA API, is get an API key. 
		This is a relatively simple process. You can apply for one 
		<a href="https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key">HERE.</a>
		The key should be emailed to you fairly quickly.<p>
