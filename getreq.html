		<h1 class="page-header">GET the Data</h1>
		<p>A GET request is a request that is sent to NASA's server which returns the data that you 
			request. GET requests are sent through the URL. For all of the data that we will request 
			from NASA, we will be using GET requests. 
			In order to ensure that we are capable of making a basic GET request and using the 
			data obtained from it, let's test out one of the more popular functions of the NASA API. 
			We'll make a call to the server in order to retrieve and display the NASA image of the day. 
			We will need HTML and JavaScript for this process. Below, you can find the code in a 
			JSFiddle example:
		</p>
		
		<h4>test</h4>
		<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/allisbri/g3ogsfo9/embedded/js,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		
		
		<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/allisbri/g3ogsfo9/embed/js,html/"></script>
		<h3 class="page-header">HTML for APoD</h3>
		<p>First take a look at the HTML in the above code by clicking the HTML tab. We can see that the 
		html body is relatively simple. We have a place for the image title, the image, and the image description. 
		The text content for the description and the title start out as empty fields in the HTML doc. 
		We are going to be filling this information in via our javascript code.</p>
		
		<h3 class="page-header">JavaScript for APoD</h3>
		<p>Now, take a look at the request variable in the javascript code. This is what we will be sending to NASA 
		so that the server knows what to send back. Before we can send the request though, we have to specify what 
		information we are requesting. This is a GET request, which means we are sending the request
		as a URL. So, <mark>request.open("GET", url + apiKey, true)</mark>, is specifying that this is a GET request and providing 
		the URL. The URL that we need to use is provided from NASA on the API site, <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod">HERE.</a>
		However, we have to add our api key to this as well. That's why <mark>?api_key=</mark> is added to the request. 
		The actual apiKey that I used has been withheld from this tutorial, but all you need to do is fill in the right side of 
		the apiKey variable with your own key. 
		</br></br>
		You will also notice that the last argument of the request.open method call is "true". 
		This means that we are making an asynchronous request. An asynchronous request allows for other processes to occur before the 
		response is received. Asynchronous requests are made because the requests can take a long time to process, and it can impair 
		the appearance and function of the website if all processing halts until the response is received. That is why an event listener 
		is added to the request. So that, when the response is received, the last argument, which is a function, is called. When this 
		function is called, it evaluates whether the response status was between 200 and 400 (no errors occurred). If no errors occurred, 
		then we can start populating the page with elements from the response that we received. NASA's API doesn't seem to provide a lot 
		of information about the response, so let's take a look at it.</p>
