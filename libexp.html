		<h1 class="page-header">Library Functions</h1>
		<p>We are going to develope functions to help us display each asteroid's name and its distance from the earth, 
		in a table, on a webpage. The first thing that might help us to do this, is to have direct 
		access to an array that contains the information for each asteroid. The function below returns 
		the array that we want. This array prevents us from having to retype 
		<mark>response.near_earth_objects[date][i]</mark> each time we want to access one of the asteroid objects, 
		by creating a new array, of which each index has a single asteroid object.</p>
			
		<h3 class="page-header">Array Function</h3>
		<script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/allisbri/b61h4gg7/embed/js/"></script>
		
		<h3 class="page-header">Get Functions</h3>
		<p>Now we will develop some functions to iterate through the array and 
		print the data we want to a webpage. Since we want the name and distance of 
		the asteroids, let's start with some functions that return that info.
		</p>
			
		<script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/allisbri/06200t52/1/embed/js/"></script>
		
		<h3 class="page-header">Print Function</h3>
		<p>Now that we have some functions to return the info we want, let's write a function 
		that iterates through the array, calls these functions, and uses the returned data to 
		create a table on our webpage.	
		</p>
		
		<script async src="http://jsfiddle.net/allisbri/u51njv1o/1/embed/js/"></script>
		
		<p>The <mark>printAsteroidDetails</mark> function starts out by setting up our table elements. 
		The function then iterates through the array, each time calling the name and distance 
		functions and adding the returned information to the corresponding cells for that row. 
		The end result is a complete table with 2 columns and a number rows equal to 
		the number of asteroids in our array. 
		You can view an example of my page that implements these functions, <a href="DemoFiles/nasaNeo.html">HERE.</a>
		That's the end of the tutorial. Check out <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#authentication">https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#authentication</a>
